# Changelog

All notable changes to PM Toolkit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Source view toggle** — Floating button in the top-right of the markdown editor opens the raw `.md` source in VS Code's default text editor beside the WYSIWYG view. Edits in either pane sync to the same file.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Editor width toggle** — Floating button in the top-right of the markdown editor switches between focused (900px) and full-width layouts. Choice persists across sessions via `localStorage`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Search & Replace** — Find text with `Cmd/Ctrl+F`. Matches highlight inline with a counter ("2 of 5"). Navigate with `Enter` / `Shift+Enter`, replace the current match or all matches at once. `Cmd/Ctrl+H` opens find+replace. `Escape` closes.
- **Export to HTML** — Export any markdown document to a self-contained `.html` file with inlined CSS. Opens in any browser. Available from the editor title bar menu.
- **Export as Markdown** — Export a clean `.md` file with comment annotations stripped. Available from the editor title bar menu alongside PDF and HTML export.
- **AI Diff Mode** — When Cursor, Claude Code, or another AI tool edits an open file, PM Toolkit highlights added (green), removed (red), and changed (yellow) content. Configure via `pmtoolkit.diff.aiDiffMode`: `cursor` mode highlights changes and lets your AI tool handle accept/reject; `claude-code` mode adds Accept All / Reject All buttons directly in PM Toolkit.
- **Inline Comments** — Select text and click the comment icon in the bubble menu to attach a comment. Comments are stored as `==highlighted text==^[comment]` directly in the markdown file — no sidecar files, fully portable, version-control friendly. View, edit, and delete from the comments panel below the editor.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-16

### Changed

- PDF export now uses Chrome's native `--print-to-pdf` CLI instead of `puppeteer-core`, eliminating a 14MB dependency
- Extension package reduced from 21MB to 2MB by fixing `.vscodeignore` to exclude source maps and stale website build artifacts

### Removed

- `puppeteer-core` dependency — PDF export uses zero external dependencies

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Extension failed to activate: `puppeteer-core` was marked as external in the build and not included in the `.vsix` package

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Code blocks with blank lines (e.g., two class definitions separated by a blank line) no longer split into separate blocks when loaded or pasted

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **PDF Export** — Export any markdown document to a pixel-perfect PDF via Command Palette or the editor title bar
  - Uses Chrome's rendering engine (via `puppeteer-core`) for output identical to the editor
  - Selectable text, proper tables, images, and Mermaid SVG diagrams
  - Auto-detects Chrome, Chromium, Edge, or Brave on macOS, Windows, and Linux
  - Configurable page size (A4, Letter, Legal, Tabloid), margins, and background printing
  - PDF saved next to the source `.md` file with "Open File" / "Open Folder" actions
  - Manual browser path override via `pmtoolkit.pdfChromePath` setting

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-08

The biggest release yet. The entire editor has been rebuilt on React 18, images and tables got ground-up redesigns, and new features like block handles, document outline, and save validation make PM Toolkit feel like a proper writing tool.

### Added

- **Block handles** — Drag handles appear in the editor gutter on hover. Drag any block to reorder it; click `+` to insert new content between blocks. Right-click a table's grip handle for quick actions (clear contents, duplicate, delete)
- **Document outline** — Collapsible heading sidebar for navigating long documents at a glance
- **Save guard** — Every save is validated before it touches your file. Blocks corrupted content containing webview URIs, internal data attributes, or excessive HTML from ever reaching disk

- **Image system redesign** — Complete overhaul of the image experience:
  - Drop zone UI for empty images — drag a file, paste a URL, or browse with the VS Code file picker
  - Drag-to-resize handles with live preview
  - Popover toolbar on click for alignment (left/center/right), replace, and delete
  - Image captions that toggle on/off and map to markdown alt text
  - Width and alignment persisted as HTML comments in markdown
  - `imageAssetsPath` setting to control where uploaded images are saved

- **Table controls redesign** — Tables went from basic to best-in-class:
  - Grip handles on rows (left edge) and columns (top edge) for drag-to-reorder with drop indicators
  - Right-click context menus on grips for insert/delete operations, with header row toggle
  - Full-width/height pill bars on last row/column for quick expansion
  - Persisted column widths with horizontal scroll for wide tables
  - Click between adjacent tables to insert a paragraph (gap-click handler)
  - Select all cells + Delete removes the entire table

- **Mermaid fit-to-view** — Diagrams default to fit-to-view mode so the full diagram is always visible (toggle to scroll/zoom for large diagrams)
- **H4 support** — Heading 4 added to slash commands and bubble menu

- **React 18 architecture** — The entire editor UI has been migrated to React:
  - All interactive components rewritten: SlashCommand, ImageNode, MermaidNode, BlockHandle, DocumentOutline, BubbleMenu, LinkPicker, TableSizePicker
  - New `Editor.tsx` entry point with `@tiptap/react` integration
  - esbuild configured for JSX compilation
  - All icons now use proper `lucide` imports via shared `LucideIcon` component (eliminated ~200 lines of inline SVG strings)

- **285 E2E tests** — Up from 192. New coverage for images, tables, serialization, VS Code message handlers, settings, and save validation

### Changed

- **Theme-adaptive accent color** — Unified selection highlights, focus rings, and interactive elements under `--pmtoolkit-accent` CSS variable that adapts to light/dark themes
- **Consistent floating menus** — All floating menus (slash command, bubble menu, image popover, table context menu) now share consistent sizing: 12px font, 4px 8px padding, 6px border-radius
- **Cleaner add bars** — Table add-row/column bars only appear when hovering the last row/column (less visual noise)
- **Settings polish** — Toggle switches use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors
- **Branding cleanup** — Removed "Obsidian" and "Notion" references from descriptions and UI

### Fixed

- Block handle drag-and-drop works correctly with ProseMirror's native drag system
- Image serialization preserves width and alignment through markdown round-trips
- Caption toggle preserves alt text instead of deleting it
- External content updates no longer pollute the undo history
- Mermaid diagrams no longer enter edit mode on initial click
- Mermaid placeholder content resolved in directly-parsed nodes
- Template loading ported to React editor entry point
- Slash command menu positioning near editor edges

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-05

  - Block type dropdown (Text, Headings 1-3, Bullet/Numbered/Task lists, Quote, Code block)
  - Formatting buttons: Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, Inline code
  - Link button (integrates with file picker and URL form)
